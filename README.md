A lightweight way of interacting with a Snowflake Data Warehouse

# Motivation
There are a set of operations that I perform very regularly, namely:
- query the database
- load new data in
- perform simple ddl
- describe table structure

And this interface is designed to simplify all of these common actions in the most efficient way possible.


# Usage
## Credentials
First things first, you need to specify what credentials to use. You do this by adding a config.ini file. Refer to the example config.ini file.
